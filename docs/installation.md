# Installation

## Installing with composer

The recommended way to install Docker PHP is of course to use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/):

```json
{
    "require": {
        "omauger/docker-compose-php": "@dev"
    }
}
```

**Note**: there is no stable version of Docker-compose PHP yet.

## Manual installation

Download the latest package manually. Extract it and include the file vendor/autoload.php in your project.
