DOCKER-COMPOSE PHP
==================

**Docker-compose PHP** is a [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) SDK written in PHP. This library is still a work in progress.
Not much is supported yet, but the goal is to reach 100% of docker-compose options support.

This is supported for docker version 1.9 and docker-compose version 1.5.

[![Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/omauger/docker-compose-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/omauger/docker-compose-php) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/docker-compose-php/badge/?version=latest)](http://docker-compose-php.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Versioning
----------

There is no *stable* version yet and docker-compose is rapidly evolving, but we still try to semantically version the library according to [semver](http://semver.org/), but shifted a little bit:

* **MAJOR** version number stays to 0 until all options of docker-compose 1.5 are covered
* **MINOR** version number is incremented when a backward incompatible change is made
* **PATCH** version number is incremented when a new feature is added

So basically, if you want the `0.1` version set, pull the tag`0.1.0` and you should be fine.

Installation
------------

The recommended way to install Docker PHP is of course to use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/):

```json
{
    "require": {
        "omauger/docker-compose-php": "@dev"
    }
}
```

**Note**: there is no stable version of Docker-compose PHP yet.
